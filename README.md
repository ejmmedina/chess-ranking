# The Winners' Circle: Ranking Chess' Grandest Of All Time
##### Data Mining and Wrangling mini-project by James Bryan Labergas & Elijah Justin Medina

We scraped chess players information and matches from <a href="http://www.chessgames.com">chessgames</a> for the top 100 players based on their FIDE rankings. We then build a network of top players connected by their advantage over other top players (i.e. net win). From this, we measure the PageRank in order to quantify the skill of the player based on the players they defeat.
